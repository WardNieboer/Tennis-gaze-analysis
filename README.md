# Tennis-gaze-analysis
This repository contains Python code for analyzing gaze and ball coordinates in tennis trials. The analysis includes preprocessing of eye-tracking data, application of low-pass filters, saccade detection, and calculations of various angles and speeds related to ball movement and gaze behavior. The main goal is to investigate the gaze behaviour of tennis players.
